    <p>Hi [Name],</p>

    <p>I’m Mayank, a thumbnail designer who’s been working with creators to make their videos stand out.  
    I recently made something that I believe could genuinely help boost your channel’s performance —  
    a short 2-minute pitch along with my portfolio in one place.</p>

    <p>You can check it out here:

        See my pitch + portfolio
    </a></p>

    <p>I focus on creating click-worthy thumbnails that increase CTR, with quick delivery and unlimited revisions until you’re happy.  
    If you’d like, I can show you a few design ideas for your own channel.</p>

    <p>Warm regards,<br>
    Mayank Singh<br>
